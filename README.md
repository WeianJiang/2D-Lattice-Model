# 2D-Lattice-Model
Listed files are an ongoing developing project of a graduate student project on meso-model of concrete simuliation, using python-based abaqus for finite element analysis.

Given files are a 2D lattice model, 3D-lattice, random paticle model would be later uploaded with the process of research.


Usage:
FIles name starting with "main_" are files can ONLY be compiled and run in abaqus python kernal, other files are basic algorithms and functions that can be called in "main_" files for model generating.

When in doubts, just open powershell (or command if you prefer) in this folder and type command:

"abaqus cae script=main.py"

and see what is going on.

More codes and debuging are in progress.

Feel free to and thanks for reviewing the codes.
